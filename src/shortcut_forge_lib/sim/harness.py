"""Drive the iOS Simulator well enough to install and run a Shortcut.

Everything here was established by experiment against a booted iOS 27 sim; the
non-obvious findings are recorded in docs/simulator-harness.md. The three that shape this file:

  * A shortcut is installed by opening it as a *host* file URL. Simulator
    processes see the Mac's filesystem, so `file:///Users/...` resolves.
    `shortcuts://import-shortcut` is iCloud-only and will not take a local file.
  * A synthesized click needs a MouseMoved event first and ClickState set, or
    the cursor moves and nothing is pressed.
  * Consent prompts ("allow this shortcut to connect to localhost") block the
    run. The affirmative button is always the bottom-most iOS-blue one, which
    is enough to dismiss every prompt shape without reading any text.

Xcode 27 deleted Simulator.app and replaced it with Device Hub, which changed
every one of those clicks' addresses but none of their logic. See the _Host
classes below for what differs and docs/simulator-harness.md for how it was established.

# exists at all, and how device pixels map to screen points. Simulator.app had
# Point Accurate and a bezel toggle, which made that mapping exact arithmetic on
# the window frame. Device Hub has neither, so the screen has to be found in
# pixels inside the bezel it always draws.
